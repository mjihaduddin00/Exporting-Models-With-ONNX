# Exporting-Models-With-ONNX
This is a sample project that is meant to be imported into a Notebook (Jupyter) to see it in action. This sample is merely to provide an example of what the Notebook should look like when converting to an ONNX model. In this project, we use the CoreML model from the forked repository "YOLO-CoreML-MPSNNGraph."
